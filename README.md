After receiving so much grattitude in  [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrackSupport/comments/p7c3jb/finally_minecraft_windows_10_crack/), I felt the need to post an updated, more sophisticated, and  **easier**  one with a very nice gui doing everything for you.

_This is a super easy method i discovered a while ago. It is not really a crack. Just a method to fool minecraft and prevent it from microsoft store to acquire the license. I am playing minecraft for months using it and i didn't encounter any problem._

============= Final result ==========

Steps to follow:
1.  Download minecraft trial version and python 3.8 from microsoft store (see steps 1 and 2 in  [the older post](https://www.reddit.com/r/PiratedGames/comments/p7c4a6/finally_minecraft_windows_10_crack/))
2.  Download  [the launcher script](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ebSksO9o7JRLe_O7iYKBFY9u0rbSDNaf/view?usp=sharing)  and run it.

4. Press enable and follow the instructions. If it works you should see this dialog

4. Press launch minecraft. If it's your first time opening the launcher, a popup dialog will ask you to open minecraft ( the trial you've downloaded earlier) for detecting the appid. Carefully read the instructions and you should be alright with this dialog appearing (I don't know if it's safe to show my app id so I blured it)

5. Press ok and enjoy :D

6. If you want to disable the crack just close the above window ;)

Note: there are some customizable options in the edit menu (but you won't generally need to edit them)

Many thanks to  [u/YouAreSmartAndIAmNot](https://www.reddit.com/u/YouAreSmartAndIAmNot/)  for cleaning up the code of the console version  [here](https://pastebin.com/dhXbXQ4E)  (since my code is a big mess) adding some features, which I implemented in gui. He has motivated me to continue working on this project.

# F.A.Q:

-   **How long does it take to download and install pil, because mine never opened once i clicked "ok"?**
    

Maybe you have a slow internet connection. Just wait a moment until it installs. OR you can download it manually by opening command prompt and running "python -m pip install Pillow"

-   **I am having problems with the script (won't launch, crash ...). How do I diagnostize the problem?**
    

If you are having problems with the script, rename it to  [launcher.py](https://launcher.py/), open cmd and type python  [launcher.py](https://launcher.py/)  and an error should occur. Please show me the exact error you are getting and I'll help you solve your problem.

# MAJOR PROBLEM FIXED!

I just fixed the problem where the script doesn't launch at all even after downloading PIL. Please download it again and see if it works

**If you encounter any problems or sth was unclear, send me message describing your issue. I will edit the post to help future users.**

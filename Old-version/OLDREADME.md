# (Finally) Minecraft Windows 10 crack

This is a super easy method i discovered a while ago. It is not really a crack. Just a method to fool minecraft and prevent it from microsoft store to acquire the license. I am playing minecraft for months using it and i didn't encounter any problem.

If you don't use the optional method the game might tell you to unlock the game after playing a couple of hours.

1. Head to the microsoft store and download it's trial version (or demo or whatever it is called)

2. [Optional] Also download python from the mircrosoft store (preferably 3.8)

3. Make sure to close the microsoft store and open task manager (if you don't know how just use search). Go to the tab "Services" and look for ClipSVC. Right click, and then stop.

4. Download [these 3 files](https://github.com/misike12/Minecraft-Windows-10-edition-crack-with-gui-python/tree/main/Old-version/Minecraft%20Crack). Open "enable.reg" if it asks for permissions or warns you for sth always accept. If it worked you should get a message similar to this.

5. [Optional] Open "no trial.py". You should see some "############" if it works properly. Do not close it until you have finished playing minecraft. Note that this script automatically closes RuntimeBroker (which enables minecraft to communicate with microsoft store) and does not harm your computer in any way. You can open it with notepad and see it is totally safe.

6. Just open minecraft (the trial you've downloaded earlier) and Boom! You can even sing into your microsoft account, play on servers, add friends and do whatever you want! Enjoy!

NB: next time you want to play, just do the 5th step and you are ready to go !

Please tell me in the comments if you ran into problems or found sth complicated

PLEASE NOTE THAT YOU MAY RUN INTO PROBLEMS WITH MICROSOFT STORE APP AFTERUSING THIS METHOD (UPDATES NOT INSTALLING, APP NOT LAUNCHING). IF YOU DO AND YOU WANT TO FIX IT, OPEN THE FILE "disable.reg" AND REENABLE "ClipSVC" IN TASK MANAGER.
